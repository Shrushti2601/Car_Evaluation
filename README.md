This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately evaluate cars based on their characteristics. 
The goal is to predict the car's acceptability (unacceptable, acceptable, very acceptable, or highly acceptable) using a dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.
The dataset used in this project is the Car Evaluation dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.
The dataset contains 1728 instances with 6 attributes: buying, maint, doors, persons, lug_boot, and safety. 
The target variable is the car's acceptability, which is categorized into four classes: unacceptable, acceptable, very acceptable, and highly acceptable.
Four machine learning algorithms were used to evaluate the cars:
1. Logistic Regression (LR)
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
3. Decision Tree (DT)
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The accuracy of each algorithm is as follows:
1. Logistic Regression (LR): 0.6997518610421837
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): 0.9503722084367245
3. Decision Tree (DT): 1.0
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM): 0.9305210918114144
Conclusion
The Decision Tree algorithm achieved the highest accuracy of 1.0, indicating that it is the most effective algorithm for evaluating cars in this dataset.
